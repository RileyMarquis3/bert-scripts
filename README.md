# Overview

This repo contains various bash source files that contain

functions I have created or knabbed from the internets.

The file name indicates the context of usage, 

e.g. file.functions.sh contains bash functions specific to file system operations. 

For your convenience, I have included an installation script that takes care of sourcing all library files in this repository.

You can invoke the installation script via curl as follows:

`source <(curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berttejeda/bert.bash/master/.installer.sh)`
